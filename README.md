# toktok

Status: Early stage

Toktok is supposed to be a self-configured and self-hosted uptime monitoring tool.
You will be able to monitor URLs, databases, servers, etc., by simply configuring a YAML file.
With a properly configured YAML, the built-in scheduler and specific executors will check your services for you.
And, of course, if something's not home, you'll be warned!
